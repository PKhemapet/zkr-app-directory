**The zkRollup Directory**

A website to present all current zkRollup projects in an easy to view layout.

Verion 1.0 is quite basic, we will continue to work on it and if you want to help please let us know, or do a pull request.

**Planning for 2022**

The zkRollups Directory (zkRollups.xyz) is fast becoming a popular resource for identifying and tracking the latest projects building and building on this cutting edge technology.

Launched on the 2nd December 2021 the website has now had in excess of 42,000 unique visitors and 49,000 page views and is on page one of google when searching for zkRollups.

The website started out when we decided to track the wider zkRollup ecosystem. The first release was just a handful of the obvious projects, however since launch and with the help of the zk community we have grown to include over 90 projects on the site. We also have interest from people and projects reaching out to be involved or to be added as a featured post.

So, as zkRollups and associated tech moves forward at an ever increasing pace so must the development of the zkRollup Directory - some of our current plans include;

**Improve layout and navigation:**

We plan to undertake an overhaul of the website to improve both its usability and design. 

This will include a wider range of categorisation and filtering of results, e.g. Sort by: A-Z, date added, Live, TestNet, Beta, etc.

**Add project details pages:**

We will link cards to their own dedicated project pages where you will find more detailed information on the project alongside relevant links.

**Add token pages:** 

There are a lot of people asking about project tokens so will add a dedicated token page with what projects have tokens and which ones are planning a token.

Data on this page will be sourced from authoritative sources (i.e. the project or a verified tracker such as CoinGecko) - we will not link to any exchanges,

**Add comparison features:** 

For example pages that compare the features of wallets or DeFi platforms.

**Content and marketing**

- Social media: Official Twitter, Reddit etc 
- Newsletter: fortnightly email/blog newsletter
- Interviews: video and text interviews with zk projects
